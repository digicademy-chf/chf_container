======================
Project-specific files
======================

This container set-up may be **adapted to custom projects** via a set of
additional files that should be stored and regularly updated in an independent
storage. You can re-create your custom container environment by dropping them
into a local clone of this repo and creating the containers. Please make sure
that you do not store files containing secret credentials or user data in
public or semi-public repositories.

..  _database-file:

Database file
=============

While most files can be backed up as they are, it is recommended that you back
up your database(s) periodically instead of relying on the runtime files stored
in the :file:`Database` folder (and, if you use the ``table`` profile for
NoCoDB, in the ``Tablebase`` folder). Use this command to **generate a database
file**, and adjust ``chf`` and ``password`` as required:

..  code-block:: shell

    podman exec -i chf_database mariadb-dump -uroot -ppassword chf_t3 > database.sql

For the NoCoDB database, use this command:

..  code-block:: shell

    podman exec -i chf_tablebase mariadb-dump -uroot -ppassword chf_nc > tablebase.sql

..  _typo3-sitepackage:

TYPO3 sitepackage
=================

When you are producing a new TYPO3 and CHF instance, you may want your **own
sitepackage** to store your configuration, overrides, and additional code. Feel
free to clone and use the boilerplate
`CHF Project <https://github.com/digicademy-chf/chf_project>`__ as a
template.

..  _ssl-certificate-files:

SSL certificate files
=====================

For an entirely new production environment, you may need to use a **cert bot**
to produce the two files :file:`cert.crt` and :file:`cert.key` via
`Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org/>`__ or another certificate authority.
The files validate secure connections to your public website and need to be
renewed periodically.
